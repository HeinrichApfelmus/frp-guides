FRP Guides
==========

This respository collects tutorials, guidelines, examples, patterns and half-baked ideas on functional reactive programming (FRP).

At the moment, it is organized a bit like a curated Wiki. If you've found a nice code pattern, or a cool link, don't hesitate to make a pull request.

The focus is on FRP libraries written in [Haskell][], using the style originally pioneered by Conal Elliott, and developed e.g. in the [reactive-banana][], [frpnow][] or [sodium][] libraries.

External Resources
------------------

* FRP was pioneered by Conal Elliott and his writings are a good source on the topic.
  * ["Functional Reactive Animation"][2a] — This is the seminal paper that started the whole FRP thing. It's still a nice, though somewhat outdated overview of FRP.
  * ["Declarative event-oriented programming"][2b] — Practial example that demonstrates the utility of FRP for GUI programming. Excellent introduction to the general programming philosophy.
  * ["Push-pull functional reactive programming"][2c] — Good read for understanding how the model is mapped to an API in terms of applicative and other functors.

* Stephen Blackheath and Antony Jones have written a [book "Functional Reactive Programming"][blackheath]. It is an introduction to FRP using Java as the main language, but it also describes several patterns that occur in practice.
